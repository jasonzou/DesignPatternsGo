# Design Patterns 

- Creational design patterns
- Structual design patterns
- Behavioural design patterns
- Concurrent design patterns

## Creational design patterns

- Abstract Factory
Creates an instance of several families of classes
- Builder
Separates object construction from its representation
- Factory Method
Creates an instance of several derived classes
- Object Pool
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
- Prototype
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- Singleton
A class of which only a single instance can exist

## Structual design patterns

- Adapter
Match interfaces of different classes
- Bridge
Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
- Composite
A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- Decorator
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- Facade
A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- Flyweight
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- Private Class Data
Restricts accessor/mutator access
- Proxy
An object representing another object

## Behavioural design patterns
- Chain of responsibility
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- Command
Encapsulate a command request as an object
- Interpreter
A way to include language elements in a program
- Iterator
Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- Mediator
Defines simplified communication between classes
- Memento
Capture and restore an object's internal state
- Null Object
Designed to act as a default value of an object
- Observer
A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- State
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- Strategy
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- Template method
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- Visitor
Defines a new operation to a class without change

## Concurrent design patterns

- Active Object
- Balking
- Binding properties
- Compute kernel
- Double-checked locking
- Event-based asynchronous
- Guarded suspension
- Join
- Lock
- Messaging design pattern (MDP)
- Monitor object
- Reactor
- Read-write lock
- Scheduler
- Thread pool
- Thread-specific storage
- Safe Concurrency with Exclusive Ownership
- CPU atomic operation
